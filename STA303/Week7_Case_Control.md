# Week 7 Case and Control



Case: 得癌症

Control: 不得癌症

1. cohort study

   find samples, 1000 smoker, 1000 non smoker

   跟踪调查50年

   时间太长了

2. case and control

   Find 1000 with cancer

   Find 1000 without cancer

## Assumption:

选择做case control的sample一定要跟X's无关，given y。

- Inclusion in the study doesn't depend on covariates

- e.g. in a cancer study

  - This would be violated if **healthy** smokers were hard to recruit

    Then smokers would be underrepresented in the controls (更少的健康人参与了study)

    and we'd over-estimate the smoking/cancer effect

    健康的参与者少了，那cencer的比例就会比正常高。

  - 或者smokers were worried about cancer and were easy to recruit

    smokers would be over-represented in controls

    we'd underestimate smoking-cancer effects

  

  ## Problems

  People don't answer the phone anymore, controls are hard to recruit

  Controls have personal reasons for wanting to be in the study (家族遗传，heavy smoker)
